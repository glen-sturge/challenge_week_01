Challenge Week 01.
==================



For Challenge Week I decided to take on learning some Kotlin.
I used the IntelliJ IDEA IDE by jetbrains. They are also the creators of the language.
It seems it is most notably in regular usage for android app development but is not limited to this.


More information on Kotlin can be found at: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)

and

https://kotlinlang.org/


I've included the two files I worked on.


dataTypes.kt:
=============
A kotlin data types tutorial. Not meant to be a functional program as much as one could load it to see how the data types function. These are identical to java data types as I understand it.

There is a program menu that allows selection for each of the data type demos.
I really liked the available 'when' syntax I used to do the menu selection.


main.kt:
========
Again, not meant to be a fully functional program of any substantial usage.

I've made two classes to define a data type of person() and address().
address() is an attribute of person().
Both classes have methods to print it's information.

There are functions called personCreate() and getAddress().
personCreate() creates a person object and calls getAddress() in it's process.

The main function goes in a loop creating person objects, adding them to a list.
Then asks user if would like to add another.
Once user prompts to stop, it displays each person() details in the personList.


Notes:
======
Overall, I really enjoyed working with kotlin. 
It was very similar to python in some ways but also quite different in others.
I do plan to continue learning this language. I give it a big thumbs up.
